            <p>Porcupine Tree have managed to defy genres and blend together numerous ambient, rock and avant-garde styles to
                create a musical landscape that is both refreshing and compulsively seductive. The hypnotic rhythms, spacy
                synthesizers, glissando guitar and crazy voices which made the style successful are all contained here.
